# SNHU Travel Project
## Summarize the proejct and what problem it was sovling
The SNHU Travel project was an example of what development may look like in a real company. I assumed the roles of each member on an scrum-agile team (Scrum Master, Product Owner, Developer, Tester) to try and understand how properly organize and contribute as each of the roles.

## Describe your project in more detail
The project was initially to create a travel website for SNHU travel in order to help them maintain their position as a top travel agency. To achieve this the team was directed to work with SNHU to iterate through different renditions of the website until we finally arrived at focusing on health/welness due to its popularity and trend increase. This project required work from every member on the team all working hand in hand. The project went through several iterations, starting with a website page and gradually turning into more of a presentation page with top 10 destinations listed for wellness/detox. Once complete the team was asked to perform a retrospective to aknowledge what went right and what could be improved upon for the next project.

## Reflect on what you have learned
The key things I learned was how a team works from making a product based on reqirements from the customer and all the way down to the developer with testing the code. There are a lot of moving parts and agile is a great way to stay organized and make sure there isn't a huge overlap in work or wasted time. 


# Retrospective:
## How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
When the Product Owner meets with the client, they are in charge of deciphering the stakeholders needs and translating them into user stories that the dev team can take action on implementing into the program.

## How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
Utilizing agile methodology when developing programs is extremely important for rapidly iterating and producing a working product each iteration. Incorporating it into my future development work with start with project planning and research, through meeting with the client or stakeholders, creating high level user stories based on those requirements, breaking it down into actionable tasks, developing test cases for each task, and technically implementing the request into code or a solution. This would happen on a weekly or bi-weekly cadence until the project was completed.

## What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Communication and transparency are two key fundamentals of scrum-agile development and translate well into being a good team member. Making sure your team members know when you are struggling or blocked on something is important to keeping the project progressing. This can happy during the daily standups and the Scrum Master can help to remove roadblocks after the meeting.
